Be Nice 2 Me
    by Bladee 

So guess what
What? I don't know
Take a knife and drain your life, hahaha (uh, uh, uh)
If it's a depot, gotta bite it (bite, go)
If I see weed, I gotta light it (uh, uh)
If I get feelings, gotta hide it (gotta hide, uh, uh)
If it's illegal, I don't mind it (I don't mind, uh, uh)
I broke my wrist, I gotta ice it (uh)
I wanna see you be my sidekick (uh, uh, uh)
If I post pics, you gotta like it (uh, uh, uh)
If you do this, then you're the nicest (uh, uh)
To be honest, if it's wrong, I don't want to be right
I don't wanna talk if you're not gonna talk to me nice
To be honest, if it's wrong, I don't want to be right
I don't wanna talk if you're not gonna talk to me nice
Talk to me nice, talk to me nice
I don't wanna talk if you're not gonna talk to me nice
Talk to me nice, talk to me nice
I don't wanna talk if you're not gonna talk to me nice
Two strike is nothing, I three-strike it (strike it)
Can't name the feeling, man, that I get (I get)
All this shit, I'm goin' through a crisis (through a crisis)
If you do this for me, you're the nicest (you're the nicest)
You're the nicest, my sleeve pull surprises
How many times I prayed? I pray three, I'm not anxious
Gotta play the game and it's free but not painless
I slide D&G, Silver Link, fuck a razor
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh (be nice to me)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh (be nice to me)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh (be nice to me)
Oh (be nice to me)
